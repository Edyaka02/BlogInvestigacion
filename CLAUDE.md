### Analysis Summary

I cannot directly generate a diagram of your entire codebase. My capabilities are focused on providing information about the code in a textual format, and I can help you understand its structure and functionality.

However, I can help you in a few ways that might lead to a diagram:

1.  **Summarize a specific file as a Mermaid diagram:** If you have a particular file in mind (e.g., a complex class or module), I can generate a Mermaid diagram representing its internal structure (classes, functions, and their relationships). You can then use an online Mermaid editor to visualize it.
2.  **Describe the architecture in a way that you can diagram:** If you tell me what aspects of your code you're interested in (e.g., "How do the main components interact?", "What's the data flow for X feature?"), I can provide a textual description that you could then use to create a diagram yourself.
3.  **Help you identify key components for a diagram:** I can help you explore the codebase to identify the main modules, services, or classes that you might want to include in a diagram.

Could you please tell me:

*   **What specifically do you want to diagram?** (e.g., the overall architecture, a specific module, the flow of a particular feature)
*   **What is the purpose of the diagram?** (e.g., to understand dependencies, to explain a process, to refactor)

Once I have a better understanding of your needs, I can assist you more effectively.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Understanding the Core Capabilities and Limitations**
   The initial response clarifies that direct diagram generation of an entire codebase is not possible. Instead, it outlines several alternative approaches to help the user achieve their goal of understanding or visualizing their code. These approaches include summarizing specific files as Mermaid diagrams, describing architecture for manual diagram creation, and assisting in identifying key components for a diagram.

2. **Generating Mermaid Diagrams for Specific Files**
   One approach offered is the ability to summarize a specific file's internal structure as a Mermaid diagram. This involves representing elements like classes, functions, and their relationships within that particular file. The user can then use an online Mermaid editor to visualize this output.

3. **Describing Architecture for Manual Diagram Creation**
   Another method involves providing a textual description of the codebase's architecture. This description focuses on how main components interact or the data flow for a particular feature, enabling the user to create a diagram themselves based on this information.

4. **Identifying Key Components for Diagramming**
   The system can also assist in identifying the main modules, services, or classes within the codebase. This helps the user pinpoint the most relevant components to include in their own diagrams, providing a foundational understanding for visualization.

5. **Clarifying User Needs for Tailored Assistance**
   To provide the most effective assistance, the system requires clarification from the user. This includes understanding what specific part of the code they wish to diagram (e.g., overall architecture, a module, a feature flow) and the purpose of the diagram (e.g., understanding dependencies, explaining a process, refactoring).
